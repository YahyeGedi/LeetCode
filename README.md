My leetcode Journey


Documenting my solutions to leetcode questions.

1. Contains Duplicate was pretty simiple. Just use a set O(n) Space and Time
2. For Valid Anagram use 2 hashmaps and check if their equal. Uses O(n) Space and Time. My solution is pretty slow saying I beat only 5 percent of users. Need to optimize that.
